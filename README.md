# CareForAll - Donation Platform

A robust, fault-tolerant microservice-based donation platform built for the API Avengers Hackathon.

## Architecture Overview

This platform addresses the critical failures that plagued the old system:
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate charges from webhook retries
- **Outbox Pattern**: Ensures reliable event publishing even during crashes
- **State Machine**: Prevents backward state transitions in payments
- **CQRS Read Model**: Pre-computed totals for high-performance reads
- **Observability**: Full monitoring, logging, and tracing

## Services

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| API Gateway | 8080 | Nginx-based routing and load balancing |
| User Service | 3001 | Authentication and user management |
| Campaign Service | 3002 | Campaign CRUD operations |
| Pledge Service | 3003 | Donation handling with idempotency |
| Payment Service | 3004 | Payment processing with state machine |
| Totals Service | 3005 | CQRS read model for campaign totals |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ (for local development)

### Running the Platform

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

Access the platform:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8080
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080/api
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Jaeger**: http://localhost:16686

## API Endpoints

### Users
```
POST /api/users/register - Register new user
POST /api/users/login    - User login
GET  /api/users/me       - Get current user
```

### Campaigns
```
GET    /api/campaigns          - List all campaigns
POST   /api/campaigns          - Create campaign (auth required)
GET    /api/campaigns/:id      - Get campaign details
PUT    /api/campaigns/:id      - Update campaign
DELETE /api/campaigns/:id      - Delete campaign
GET    /api/campaigns/stats    - Get campaign statistics
```

### Pledges/Donations
```
POST /api/pledges              - Create pledge (with idempotency key)
GET  /api/pledges              - List all pledges
GET  /api/pledges/:id          - Get pledge details
GET  /api/pledges/campaign/:id - Get pledges for campaign
GET  /api/pledges/donor/me     - Get my donations
```

### Payments
```
POST /api/payments              - Create payment
POST /api/payments/webhook      - Payment provider webhook
GET  /api/payments/:id          - Get payment details
```

### Totals (CQRS Read Model)
```
GET /api/totals                  - Get all campaign totals
GET /api/totals/campaign/:id     - Get specific campaign total
GET /api/totals/stats            - Get platform statistics
```

## Key Features

### 1. Idempotency (Pledge & Payment Services)
Every pledge/payment request can include an `idempotency_key`. Duplicate requests return the same response without re-processing.

```javascript
POST /api/pledges
{
  "campaign_id": "uuid",
  "donor_email": "donor@example.com",
  "donor_name": "John Doe",
  "amount": 100,
  "idempotency_key": "unique-key-123"  // Optional
}
```

### 2. Outbox Pattern (Pledge Service)
Events are written to an outbox table in the same transaction as the business operation, then published asynchronously by a background worker.

```
1. BEGIN TRANSACTION
2. Insert pledge into pledges table
3. Insert event into outbox_events table
4. COMMIT TRANSACTION
5. Background worker publishes events from outbox
```

### 3. Payment State Machine
Prevents invalid state transitions:
```
PENDING → AUTHORIZED → CAPTURED → COMPLETED
    ↓         ↓            ↓
    └─────────┴────────────┴──→ FAILED
```

Backward transitions (CAPTURED → AUTHORIZED) are blocked to prevent data corruption.

### 4. CQRS Read Model (Totals Service)
Campaign totals are pre-computed and cached, eliminating expensive recalculations on every read request.

## Scalability

Services can be scaled using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  pledge-service:
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
```

## Observability

### Metrics (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Service health checks
- Request rates and latencies
- Error rates

### Logging (Elasticsearch)
- Structured JSON logs
- Centralized log aggregation

### Tracing (Jaeger)
- Distributed request tracing
- End-to-end donation flow visibility

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline:
1. **Detects changed services** - Only builds/tests modified services
2. **Runs tests** - Unit tests for each service
3. **Builds Docker images** - Tagged with commit SHA
4. **Creates releases** - Semantic versioning (v1.0.0)
